Guidance: An integrated Framework for Genome-wide Imputation and Association Testing on Parallel Computing Platforms.
Guidance is a research tool to phase, impute genotypes and perform association testing that requires minimal configuration 
and delivers optimal and robust results. It is portable to different platforms, ranging from simple destktop computers 
to distributed computing infrastructures, such as Clusters, Grids and Clouds, without software modifications or complex
setup processes. Guidance allows merging the results from different reference panels, (e.g., UK10K, and 1000 Genomes),
and generates graphical and summary outputs providing amenable information to non-expert users for the biological interpretation 
of the results. 

Guidance was implemented by means of COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) (Tejedor and Badia, 2008), a framework that aims to 
facilitate the development and execution of applications for distributed infrastructures, such as clusters, clouds or grids. 
In that sense, COMPSs provides (i) a simple programming model and (ii) a runtime system that controls the parallelization of 
the application without user intervention.

Release number: 0.9.8
Release date:   20-Jul-2016
--------------------------
This is the first public release of the Guidance software.

	* Workflow style execution of the following stages:
		- Pre-phasing
		- Imputation
		- Post-inputation filtering
		- Merging results from several panels
		- Strand homogenization
		- Association test
		- Top-hit results
                - Phenome-wide association
		- Graphical results: Manhattan and QQ plots
