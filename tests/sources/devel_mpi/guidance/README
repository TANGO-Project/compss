1. What is Guidance [1]
-------------------------------------------
  Guidance: An Integrated Framework for performing Large-scale Genome-wide Imputation,
  Association Testing ang phenome-wide Association. Guidance is a research tool that 
  efficiently performs large-scale genotype imputation, together with the corresponding 
  association testing on huge amount of sample sizes and using large and dense reference 
  panels, in a single execution and without user intervention, generating final graphical
  and summary outputs. Guidance integrates state of the art tools for each of these 
  steps, and it is directly portable to different computing platforms, ranging 
  from desktop computers to distributed infrastructures, such as HPC clusters, 
  grids and cloud systems, ensuring an efficient use of resources, without software 
  modification or complex setup processes. A summary of the features are:

  - It integrates the main stages that a robust GWAS workflow should meet, including 
    haplotype pre-phasing, imputation and association testing. It also allows the 
    use of common freely available and state of the art tools to perform each stage. 
    Guidance is easily configurable and adaptable according to user requirements. 
    The source code is freely available in case advanced users would like to perform 
    specific modifications in the workflow.

  - Guidance also allows merging the imputation results from several reference 
    panels, (e.g., UK10K, and 1000 Genomes, etc.), and generates graphical and summary 
    outputs providing amenable information to non-expert users for the biological 
    interpretation of the results.

  - Guidance is deployable on different type of platforms, ranging from simple 
    desktop computers to distributed computing infrastructures, (e.g. shared memory 
    machines, grids, HPC clusters and cloud environments) and makes them transparent 
    to the users. Therefore, parameters like available processors, nodes, memory 
    requirements, data transfer mechanisms, workload balance and disk space do not 
    need to be directly managed by users.

  - It accepts several input formats in which GWAS data is usually released, (.bed, 
    .ped and .gen formats), achieves high-speed output delivery and generates 
    simplified performance reports related to the imputation and GWAS processes.

  - Guidance was implemented by means of COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) [2], a 
    framework that aims to facilitate the development and execution of applications 
    for distributed infrastructures, such as clusters, clouds or grids. In that 
    sense, COMPSs provides (i) A simple programming model and (ii) a runtime system 
    that controls the parallelization of the application without user intervention.

  Guidance represents an ideal tool for large multi-center consortia, allowing 
  whole-genome imputation in a standardized way across different institutions, without 
  the need of sharing the individual-level data. Taken together, Guidance is the 
  first unified solution for integrating imputation and association tests on modern 
  computing environments and in a single execution.

----------------------------------------------
2. Recommended first step to test Guidance
----------------------------------------------
  We recommend to start using the VM that contains everything needed to run Guidance 
  with some examples, on a desktop computer. This is the easiest way to start using 
  Guidance in order to understand the process and the kind of results that Guidance
  performs. You can download the VM from http://cg.bsc.es/guidance/.

  The steps to use the VM are:

  2.1 Download de VM described in the webpage according to your system. Depending on 
      your internet connection, the downloading can take several minutes. Take into 
      account that the VM format used is vmdk for for x86 and AMD64/Intel64-based 
      systems, (X86-64 bits machines). Make sure your host machine corresponds to this 
      architecture.

  2.2 After downloading the VM, you can use any virtualization software package 
      (like VirtualBox, Vware, etc) in order to use the VM. It is possible that you
      will need to change the VM format file to any other accepted by your virtualization
      software. See the documentation of your specific virtualization software in order 
      to configure the machine. 

      We also recommend you to configure the VM using the following parameters. Take 
      into accout that these suggested parameters will depend on the features of your 
      host machine:

      - 4 CPUs.
      - Around 8 GB of RAM memory. 
      - Use Network Address Translation (NAT) as a network adapter. To run the examples
        and using Guidance in the VM, it is not required internet access in your VM. 
        Everything needed is already located into the VM.

  2.3 Start the VM. The access information is:
      - login   : user
      - password: user

  2.4 Inside the VM, open a terminal and go to the directory with the examples, by using 
      the command line:

      > cd /home/user/guidance

  2.5 Open the README_for_examples document. You can do it from the command line by using 
      kate editor:

      > kate README_for_examples &

      The README_for_examples file contains the instructions on how to run the examples 
      in the VM. Follow the instructions of that document.

3. Installing Guidance
-------------------------------------------
  3.1 Important: These instructions assume that COMPSs programming framework is already 
      installed in your system, whatever it is, (e.g., Desktop, Cluter, Grid, Cloud, etc). 
      If your system does not have any installation of COMPSs, please go to 

       http://www.bsc.es/computer-sciences/grid-computing/comp-superscalar/ and
       http://cg.bsc.es/guidance/

       and follow the instructions on how to install COMPSs.

  3.2 Go to the Guidance website: http://cg.bsc.es/guidance/ , download the 
      source code guidance_X.Y.Z.tar.gz, and follow the instructions on how to install
      the application depending on your computing platform.

  3.3 There is a User Support mailing list related to Guidance. Users are encouraged
      to consider subscribing to it. You can find all the information in:

      http://cg.bsc.es/guidance/

---------------------
4. Using Guidance
---------------------
     Go to the Guidance website, and follow the instruction of the README_on_examples 
     presented in the VM.

     There is also a complete document that describes the list of parameters that Guidance
     receives. Go to website and download the document "configuration_file_parameters.pdf".
